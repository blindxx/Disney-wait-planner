/**
 * syncPayload.ts — Phase 7.6 Sync Scope Expansion
 *
 * Types and helpers for the combined planner sync payload.
 * The synced payload bundles both plans and lightning data
 * for a single signed-in user + active profile.
 *
 * Payload shape:
 *   { version: 1, plans: { version, items[] }, lightning: { version, items[] }, days?: string[] }
 *
 * Phase 11.2 Codex fix — `days` (the profile's ordered day list) is an
 * optional addition to this same version-1 shape, not a version bump: the
 * outer `version` stays 1 so existing stored rows and any code still
 * reading the pre-days shape remain valid. Older/legacy payloads omit
 * `days` entirely — callers must treat its absence as "no synced order",
 * not as an error, and fall back to their existing local reconstruction
 * (see plans/page.tsx and lightning/page.tsx pull handling).

   * Phase 11.2 Codex fix — the profile's ordered days[] (stable dayIds in

   * local order to send. Optional and omitted when absent — see the

/**
 * Normalize a raw value down to a valid ordered days[] array (preserving
 * first-occurrence order), or undefined if it isn't an array at all — a
 * missing/non-array `days` stays absent rather than manufacturing one, so
 * legacy payloads that never supplied the field are untouched. Shared by
 * the builder (push), the parser (pull and, via parseSyncedPlannerPayload,
 * the server's legacy-writer preservation) so every path that can produce
 * or accept a synced days[] applies the exact same rules.
 *
 * Phase 11.2 Codex fix — matches loadDays() (plans/page.tsx) and
 * loadKnownDays() (lightning/page.tsx) exactly, rather than merely
 * filtering: each raw entry is normalized in place (a malformed entry
 * becomes "day-1" in its own slot, same as normalizeDayId's fallback),
 * then "day-1" is appended if it still never appeared. Filtering alone
 * (the previous behavior) could produce a valid-but-day-1-less order —
 * e.g. ["bad","day-2"] sanitized to ["day-2"] — silently violating the
 * planner's permanent baseline-day invariant that every page loader
 * already enforces on read. Normalizing instead of dropping also means an
 * array that is present but contains no genuinely valid entries at all
 * (e.g. ["not-a-real-day", 123]) now sanitizes to ["day-1"], matching
 * what loadDays()/loadKnownDays() would themselves produce from that same
 * raw array (they treat any non-empty array as "there is a days list
 * here", never as "absent") — it is only a fully missing/non-array value
 * that stays absent.

// ===== PARSERS / VALIDATORS =====

/**
 * Parse and validate a raw unknown value as a SyncedPlannerPayload.
 * Returns null if the shape is missing or invalid — callers treat null as
 * "no data" and fall through to local-only mode.
 *
 * `days`, when present, is sanitized rather than treated as all-or-nothing
 * like plans/lightning: a non-array (or entirely missing) `days` degrades
 * to "absent" (undefined) instead of rejecting an otherwise-valid payload —
 * plans/lightning data must never be discarded over a corrupted `days` tag
 * on an incidental field older clients never wrote. A present array is
 * always normalized (never dropped) — see sanitizeDaysOrder — so it never
 * comes back missing the planner's permanent "day-1" baseline day.

 * copy, not be treated as "no opinion").
 *
 * SH.3 appends "dayMeta" | "dayParks" | "dayAutoFallbacks" here (plus a

/**
 * Compute the JSON-serializable object to persist for a validated planner
 * write, given whatever is currently stored for this (user, profile).
 *
 * This is the generalized replacement for the old bespoke "if incoming
 * lacks `days`, read existing `days` and splice it in" block that used to
 * live in the PUT route. It is intentionally NOT built by starting from the
 * incoming payload and splicing in known-preservable fields — that shape
 * only protects domains this exact server build already knows the name of.
 * Instead it starts from the EXISTING stored object (`existingRaw`, spread
 * as-is, unknown keys included) and overlays only the domains the
 * INCOMING payload actually validates for:
 *
 *   - `plans` / `lightning` — always overlaid unconditionally from
 *     `incomingRaw` (parseSyncedPlannerPayload already guarantees both are
 *     present and valid on any non-null `incomingParsed`), so a genuinely
 *     empty push (e.g. Clear All) still clears the cloud copy — present
 *     empty is a real, intentional value, never conflated with absent.
 *   - Each key in OPTIONAL_DOMAIN_KEYS — overlaid from `incomingRaw` only
 *     when `incomingParsed` has a defined value for it (present AND
 *     valid); otherwise `base`'s existing value for that key (if any) is
 *     left completely untouched by this function, simply because nothing
 *     ever writes over it.
 *   - Every other key already present in `base` — including a domain this
 *     server build has never heard of (e.g. a future SH.3 `dayMeta` domain
 *     written by a newer client, then this same profile receiving a write
 *     from an old client whose payload structurally has no `dayMeta`
 *     field at all) — survives untouched via the initial object spread.
 *     This is what makes future-domain preservation NOT require a new
 *     per-field branch here: the mechanism doesn't need to know a
 *     domain's name to protect it, only the domains it's actively
 *     overlaying need to be named.
 *
 * Pure and DB-agnostic — callers own reading `existingRaw` (already
 * `JSON.parse`d, or null when no row exists / it failed to parse) under
 * whatever locking they use; this function makes no I/O decisions.
